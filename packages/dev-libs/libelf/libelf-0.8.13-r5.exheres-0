SUMMARY="ELF object file access library"
DESCRIPTION="
libelf lets you read, modify or create ELF files in an architecture-independent
way. The library takes care of size and endian issues. For example, you can
process a file for SPARC processors on an Intel-based system. This library is a
clean-room rewrite of the System V Release 4 library, and is supposed to be
source code compatible with it. It was meant primarily for porting SVR4
applications to other operating systems, but can also be used as the basis for
new applications (and as a light-weight alternative to libbfd).
